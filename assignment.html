<h1><p> Callum McCarthy-Allen</p></h1>
<h3> About Me</h3>
<p>My name's Callum but I tend to go by Cal. I'm a former retail worker who's grown up around all different kinds of technology, mostly computers and gaming consoles.
I currently volunteer with a music charity getting young teenagers interested in music and teaching them to play a variety of instruments.
Outside of work I mostly enjoy more creative projects. I run 3-5 hour sessions of Dungeons and Dragons every other week which itself includes creative writing and map design work.
I also play a lot of videogames such as shooters and RPGs and I read pretty much exclusively high fantasy novels (Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Throne of Glass, etc.)
</p>
<h3> Problem Solving</h3>
<p>The first of the problem solving examples I could think of is actually this section of the assignment.
    I thought it was pretty obsolete at first as I viewed it as the opportunity to show I understood the unordered list command we'd been taught and, given as I worked
    backwards on the assignment and already included this, I didn't see much point in using it a second time. In the end I chose to scrap the list part and use
    this issue as something to put in here.<br>
    The second issue I thought of was the recent departure of my band's drummer. He recently moved away and won't be able to make rehearsals for almost six months.
    To deal with this, we implemented very temporary measures with me taking up his instrument to avoid canceling the gigs we were already lined up to play.
    Once those gigs were done, we invited a new drummer to temporarily join the band and fill his spot so everyone could return to their normal instruments.<br>
    The last thing I can think of that'd be fairly decent to put in here was dealing with a problem player at our D&D table. It's only small but might as well throw it in.
    I run a table of soon to be seven people (it'll drop to six once problem player is gone). Our youngest player (17) has made the game incredibly difficult to play 
    as she never shows up on time despite being the reason we play on a time limit, she constantly interrupts things and probably most annoyingly, she has a strange habit both harassing
    NPCs for want of a better word and completely ignoring all of the rules and lore that surround the race and class she's played. We tried to resolve the issues by having a mature conversation,
    she didn't take the hint. Eventually other players at the table got as frustrated as me, so the solution ended up being to "suggest" her character leave 
    the group as the player happens to be busy anyway.

</p>
<h3> Education</h3>
<p>I attended Skerton Community High school for most of my high school career after initially picking Morecambe high.
    I took the required GCSEs alongside History, Geography and IT. After dropping out due for personal reasons I took a
    foundation course at Lancaster and Morecambe College for two years where I learned some basic but mostly useless skills and got a B in my English language GCSE.
    Following this I started volunteering at Moremusic in Morecambe and attended Preston's College, getting a C in my maths GCSE and an A-Level in Musical Theatre.
    If you really want to sit and read exact details I submitted my CV as part of the first assignment. Go wild I guess.
</p>
<h3> Hobbies and Interests</h3>
<p> As I stated earlier, I enjoy putting a lot of focus on creative projects in my free time,
    the biggest of which being my Dungeons and Dragons campaign which has been built almost entirely from scratch in every aspect, such as;
    <ul>-The world itself<br>
        -Cartography<br>
        -Battle Maps<br>
        -Characters<br>
        -World History<br> 
    </ul> 
<p>With this being such a big undertaking, I chose to store all my information on a content management platform called Kanka.</p>
<p>Click the button below to generate a link and go explore my project!</p>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Codex Link</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "https://kanka.io/en/campaign/146064";
}
</script>
<p> I was hoping to make the message that appears after clicking the button or the button itself a link but I couldn't quite work it out so feel free to copy and paste it until I can work out the issue. </p>
